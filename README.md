keylayout-eval
==============

A simple evaluator for computer keyboard layouts. Measures typing effort for most frequent words and most frequent n-grams.

This is made with Dart before version 1 and now there is even Dart 2 with a much changed ecosystem on how to build Dart apps and run them in the Browser.

The charts don't work with the current version of the Dart stack, but the unit tests still pass, so all the calculation-code is working and we'd only need to update the charts to make it work again.
